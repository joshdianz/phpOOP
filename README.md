How to create classes?
In order to create a class, we group the code that handles a certain topic into one place. For example, we can group all of the code that handles the users of a blog into one class, all of the code that is involved with the publication of the posts in the blog into a second class, and all the code that is devoted to comments into a third class.

To name the class, it is customary to use a singular noun that starts with a capital letter. For example, we can group a code that handles users into a User class, the code that handles posts into a Post class, and the code that is devoted to comments into a Comment class.
